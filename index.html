        <H1> Introduction </H1> 
        <br>
            <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Hello, my name is Yara and I am a sophmore in college. I am currently 19 years old, I am bilangual as I know Arabic and my mother language is English. 
                I am currently learning both French and Korean. My family consists of my mother, stepfather, two sisters, and my brother with me being the oldest out of my siblings.
                 I have yet to decide a major, therefore I am exploring different options by taking multiple introductory classes.  </p>
        
        
        
                 <H2>What I hope to Learn in My Introduction To Computer Science Course</H2>
            <ul>
                <li>How computers perform the way they do </li>
                <li>Why do computers use binary language</li>
                <li>The programming behind computers' actions</li>
                <li>More knowledge about coding</li>
                <li>How it is like to major in computer science </li>
                <li>An idea of how it would be like working in computer science</li>
            </ul>
                
        <H2> My Favorite Activity</H2>
            <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
                It is difficult to choose one activity/hobby I enjoy, but dancing is an activity I find pleasure in. I may not be the best at it, 
                but I find it enjoyable to memorize dances and perform the dance moves. The songs I choose to dance to are within the genre Kpop, 
                there are many songs that have full dances which makes it easy to choose songs to dance to. I usually practice choreographies with my 2 sisters. 
                It was really fun to follow along to dances when I went to a TXT concert. It was a magnificent experience.</p>
        <H2>Fun Fact</H2>
            <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
                I have had over 20 birds throughout my lifetime. When I was younger people would continuosly gift me chicks, which is why the number is so high. 
                I have also had 2 parakeets and 3 cockatiels. 2 cockatiels were a pair that I had when I was younger, and 1 cockatiel was my most recent pet (dare I say my favorite bird out of all
                of them).My latest bird, a cockatiel, is a parrot breed that has red cheeks and a crest. His name was Pepper but we rarely called him by his name, we called him Birbie.
                He has unfortunaetly passed away in 2021 due to an illness. I treasured him dearly. </p>
