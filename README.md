# TXT Buddy Final Project
I created an html website with CSS and JavaScript; you can learn about the band TXT and take a questionnaire which determines which member is the best buddy for you.

The idea is original from me, but I utilized some websites in constructing the website:

For the tabs: 
    General page: https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/html-css-tabs/
    Specific code: https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/QWqXYmG

For the parallax: https://www.makeuseof.com/set-background-image-css/    

For the word over the parallax: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43236327/how-to-place-text-over-a-parallax-scrolling-image

For the two headers at the very top of the page and the side of the page: 
    General page: https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/html-css-tabs/
    Specific code: https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/JjrQxew


And thanks to the help of W3C for general information regarding constructing and designing a website.
